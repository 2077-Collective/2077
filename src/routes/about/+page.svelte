                The 2077 Collective is a league of creatives, researchers,
                developers, and marketers committed to making Ethereum cool
                again. We're a funnel for individuals to come into an organized
                group, onboard, collaborate/coordinate with other individuals
                and work towards the goal of growing, educating, and promoting
                the Ethereum ecosystem. We believe Ethereum is technology for
                good and want to play a role in its adoption within and outside
                of crypto.

                We're a creative studio, research shop, and mad science lab
                rolled into oneâ€”a place where talented people can come together
                to build, research, write, and create in ways that add value to
                the Ethereum ecosystem.
