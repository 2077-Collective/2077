                There's an established community of researchers and developers
                focused on building and scaling Ethereum, but there's no unified
                community focused on promoting it. Independent marketing
                projects at the L2 or dapp/infrastructure layer—while net
                positive and beneficial for Ethereum—tend to be self-interested
                and ultimately focused on one specific (albeit important) piece
                of the puzzle they have an interest in.

                The people whose voices really matter—core developers,
                researchers, builders—are often quiet. The empty space is filled
                with competitor noise, which is often intellectually dishonest.
                This shapes the world's view of Ethereum without anyone to
                credibly counteract the psyops, dispel misinformation, and
                proactively share good narratives about Ethereum with the world.

            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-3xl">
                Too much of the Ethereum community's energy is spent in tribal
                arguments on crypto-Twitter, or talking to other crypto natives.
                Having circular arguments about the investment case or esoteric
                technical debates is not useful after a point. For most
                people,energy is better spent showing the world what users can
                do with Ethereum right now and getting people on-chain.
