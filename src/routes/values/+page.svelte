            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                We are not a traditional organization with bells and whistles.
                Crypto makes it possible for Internet strangers to coordinate
                with strangers on the Internet and pull off impressive feats. We
                provide maximum flexibility for contributors: the only
                requirement is to operate and deliver consistently.

                Open global participation
            </h2>
            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                Anyone in the world should be able to participate—irrespective
                of their background, affiliations, and philosophies—on maximally
                equal footing. Like Ethereum itself, participation in the
                Collective is permissionless and open to anyone with a desire to
                contribute positively to the Ethereum ecosystem.

                Meritocracy > bureaucracy
            </h2>
            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                We lean into anon culture and emphasize operating vs.
                performing, positive-sum games vs. zero-sum games, legitimacy by
                performance vs. legitimacy by continuity, vibrancy vs.
                sterility, and flexible structures vs. middle management and
                bureaucratic processes. The pie is big enough, and those who
                grow the pie must naturally have a (larger) share in it.

            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                Autonomy, self-leadership, and personal independence are
                necessary for innovation and creativity to thrive. We give room
                for the risk-takers, innovators, and operators to flourish and
                do their best work without stifling their freedom or raising the
                barrier to action.

            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                We're dreamers who believe in powerful ideas and their ability
                to change the world. We experiment with radical approaches and
                bet against the consensus—our efforts are geared towards playing
                long-term games and maximizing ROI on high-conviction plays. We
                allow for self-expression and believe work can and should be an
                avenue for people to create beautiful things that are
                indistinguishable from art.

            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                The speed limit doesn't exist, and the standard pace is for
                chumps. At 2077 Collective, moving fast and making things—whilst
                honoring our commitment to quality—is a credo that influences
                our short-term and long-term actions. We're big believers in
                maintaining a strong bias toward action and prioritizing (rapid)
                experimentation and execution over (prolonged) analysis and
                deliberation.

            </h2>
            <p class="text-2xl max-w-screen-5xl">
                We play for keepers and go all in. We don't play the odds or
                second-guess our chances of success. If no path exists towards
                achieving our most ambitious goals, we will make one—no obstacle
                is too large, no setback too damaging, and nothing enough to
                break our will or destroy our resolve to succeed in the market.
                We're fearless, persistent, aggressive, relentless and
                courageous; we're biased towards displaying and enacting radical
                competence and winning based on merit and the quality of our
                efforts.
